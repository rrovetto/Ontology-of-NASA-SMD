# The Ontology of NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD)

An ontology describing the NASA Science Mission Directorate and associated datasets.

### Scope
The scope of the NASA SMD Ontology includes: the [organizational](https://science.nasa.gov/about-us/leadership/org-chart) and structural aspects of the SMD, the datasets within its purview, related knowledge organization systems (e.g. classifications, the NASA Subject Headings, etc.), etc.
The scope is subject to revision.

### Purpose
* To support NASA in data management, knowledge management, etc.
* To explore the potential utility of ontology / semantic modeling / conceptual data modeling / AI knowledge representation / knowledge grahs (here collectively called 'knowledge modeling) for the SMD and the given scope.
* To innovate

### Status
- As a personal project, unfunded to date, formal support is needed to continue and sustain development

## Support - How you can help
You can help by offerring financial support, employment opportunities, graduate study opportunities whereby this can be part of my thesis or projects, co-authorship on papers or proposal, mentorship, voluntary technical expertise/servies for desired functionalities of my project, relevant datasets to apply the ontology to, and to be a user of the ontology(s).
